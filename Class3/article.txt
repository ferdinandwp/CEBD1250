I also begin learning docker in other class (CEBD1160).
I can se ethat this technology become more and more in demand.
One feature that I find it interesting is the fact that it will eventually replace virtual machine.

I can simply run ubuntu image and run a linux environment from my machine.

It is such a lightweight application which make everything run a lot faster.
